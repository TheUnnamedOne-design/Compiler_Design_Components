# Compiler Design Components

This repository contains implementations of core components used in the study of Compiler Design. Each module focuses on a specific phase or concept of a compiler, with clean and well-documented C++ implementations. The goal of this repository is to provide reference material, lab solutions, and learning resources for understanding how compilers work internally.

## Contents

The repository will include implementations of:

- Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)
- Syntax Analysis (Parsers: LL, LR, etc.)
- Syntax Trees and Parse Trees
- Symbol Tables
- Intermediate Code Generation
- Code Optimization Techniques
- Code Generation
- Supporting Algorithms and Utilities

Each component is organized in its own folder with source files, examples, and where applicable, a dedicated README.

## Usage

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Compiler_Design_Components.git
```


Navigate into any module to view or run the programs. All code is written in standard C++ and can be compiled using:

```
g++ filename.cpp -o output
```


## Purpose

This repository is intended for:

- Students taking Compiler Design courses
- Reference for lab assignments
- Anyone learning how compilers work internally
- Building foundational components that can be extended into a full compiler


More components will be added over time and will be incrementally updated accordingly.
